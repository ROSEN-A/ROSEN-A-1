# Project Setup [Important]
How to run our code?

Requirements: 
- Python version 3.11 can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
- Flask version 2.2.2 can be installed using `pip install flask==2.2.2`

To run the code:
1) Navigate to our website directory through console
2) Run this code `python server.py`
3) You will see output similar to 
``` 
* Serving Flask app 'server'
* Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
4) Head to google chrome and copy paste `http://127.0.0.1:5000`


## Project Context

Visual inspections are an effective way to detect features along a water pipeline from the inside, based on this information pipeline owners can identify and prioritize and corrective maintenance.


## Project Description

- Develop a web application that enables data scientists to classify large amounts of images (from water pipeline inspections). 

- Classes are not predefined but defined by the user's decisions. 

- Web application uses an active learning algorithm. 

- Requires to have a usable web interface that streamlines the classification task, minimizes errors and manages large volumes of data. 

- Data generated for the project uses a simulation and rendering engine.

- Images can be encoded using pre-trained neural networks, but need not to be optimized.

- Web application is the priority, the algorithm is less important.

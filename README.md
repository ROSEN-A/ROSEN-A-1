## Project Context

Visual inspections are an effective way to detect features along a water pipeline from the inside, based on this information pipeline owners can identify and prioritize and corrective maintenance.


## Project Description

- Develop a web application that enables data scientists to classify large amounts of images (from water pipeline inspections). 

- Classes are not predefined but defined by the user's decisions. 

- Web application uses an active learning algorithm. 

- Requires to have a usable web interface that streamlines the classification task, minimizes errors and manages large volumes of data. 

- Data generated for the project uses a simulation and rendering engine.

- Images can be encoded using pre-trained neural networks, but need not to be optimized.

- Web application is the priority, the algorithm is less important.

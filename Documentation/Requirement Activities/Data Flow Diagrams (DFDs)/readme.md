# Data Flow Diagrams

In this folder, you will be able to see our project's Data Flow Diagram (Level 0 and Level 1).
This is made to view the flow of information for our software from user input, to the end result.

*[NOTE]: This is to be changed one scope is refined*
## Explanation For DFD 0
DFD 0 is intended to explain the high-level overview of the flow of our program. 
As we can see from the DFD, the 3 main parts in our system would be:
1) Local file system
2) Users
3) Software that will run classification

Flow
1) All the images/videos that are required to be classified exist in the local file system
2) User will pick and input the desired classification images/videos to the software
3) User will also input a sample image, which is the desired image to be classified from 2)
4) Without covering much details, software will do classification, along with a bit of mnual intervention in order for training algorithm, to be able to detect certain images desired.
5) The software will produce output that will be rendered in the interface
6) From 5), the output will be given as images that are classified 
7) User will be able to choose whether or not this output will be saved in the local system

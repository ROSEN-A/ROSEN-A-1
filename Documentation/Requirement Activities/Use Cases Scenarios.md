# Use Cases and Scenarios

This document will cover a brief introduction to use cases and scenarios as well as providing implementations of this requirement analysis methodology to our project. This document will serve as a guide to future developments. Hopefully it will provide a clear guideline as to what and how we could develop our project based on use cases and scenarios.


## What are Use cases and Scenario

A use case is a set of steps that re required to accomplish a specific goal. 

The goal can be a feature to develop during software development or an issue to address. 

A use case can have multiple paths to reach the goal, where each of them is considered a scenario. 

Use cases are often more detailed and focused on functionality.

In simpler terms, uses cases are goals with various processes; and a scenario represents a linear path through one of the use cases.



## Benefits of Use cases

Use cases are valuable because they help explain how the system should behave and in the process, help brainstorm what could go wrong.

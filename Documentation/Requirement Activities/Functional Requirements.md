# Functional Requirements 
## Deliverable #1 - Web User Interface
1. The system should be a web application with a user interface.
2. The web user interface shall have a button ‘Upload video’ for users to browse videos on their local machines and select one. 
3. After the video is selected, the web user interface shall have a ‘Confirm’ button for users to confirm uploading.

6. After the sample image is uploaded, the active learning algorithm takes it as its training data for the first training process iteration. During the processing phase, a loading page will be displayed. 
7. After the first iteration is finished, the web application shall display a number of images with their timestamps. 
8. The web user interface shall allow users to label each image displayed by using tick-boxes. The options of ‘Select All’ and “Deselect All’ should be given to users. Images that are ticked by users are labeled ‘Interested’, those un-ticked are labeled ‘Not Interested’. Images that are labeled ‘Interested’ should include target objects. 
9. After the labeling process is done, the web user interface shall allow users to submit labels by clicking the ‘Submit’ button.
10. The web user interface shall be able to display all images containing target objects. Users shall be allowed to sort images according to their timestamps by clicking the sort button. 
11. The web application shall allow users to download the selected images by clicking the button ‘Download’.

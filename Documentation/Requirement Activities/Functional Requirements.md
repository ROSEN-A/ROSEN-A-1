# Functional Requirements 
### 1. Browsing and selecting a group of wanted images from users’ local machines
  - Firstly, our application will access users' local file systems for browsing images. 

### 2. Uploading a group of images to be classified or filtered to the software
  - Our product must allow users to select and upload a group of images for their classification tasks.

### 3. Specifying object(s)/class(es) to be classified or filtered
  - After uploading is finished, users should be able to define what they are looking for in the images uploaded (for example, fish or AmEX ceilings in the pipelines)

### 4. Creating one or more projects on the same set of images
  - After images have finished being uploaded, the system shall allow users to create multiple projects on the same set of images without the need of repetitive uploading of the same set of images. 

### 5. Displaying a set of images with object(s) defined by users
  - The system will proccess and classify images using a trained active learning algorithm togetehr with pre-trained machine learning algorithms. 
  - After process is finished, relevant images (images including object(s) which users are interested in) will be displayed. 

### 6. Showing the timestamp of every image
  - The system will automatically add a timestamp to each image.

### 7. Sort images according to timestamps
  - All images can be sorted by their accordingly timestamps, either in ascending or desending order.

### 8. Downloading selected images to users’ local machines
  - Finally, the displayed images must be able to be selected and downloaded for users' further use.

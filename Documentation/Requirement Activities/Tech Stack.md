# Tech Stack

The tech stack includes all the technologies Project ROSEN will be built with.

## Web User Interface


The technologies our team plans to implement for the Web User Interface are Dash, Python, and Javascript

- The Dash framwework is a visualization framework based on Python, which the client has required.

- For the backend, we will use Python, which is also a requirement we must adhere to.

- Javascript will be used for the frontend, along with HTML and CSS.

## Prototype Modelling & Active Learning Algorithm


The technologies our team plans to implement for the Prototype Modelling and the Active Learning Algorithm are OpenCV, Blender, and VGG-16.

- OpenCV will be used for processing the images/video frames.

- Blender will be used to simulate models for the pipeline prototypes.

- VGG-16 is the neural network encoder that converts images to vectors, which will be used as input for our active learning algorithm.

We are currently still researching what active learning algorithm to implement, one possibility is ModAL, an active learning framework for Python with lots of flexibility.

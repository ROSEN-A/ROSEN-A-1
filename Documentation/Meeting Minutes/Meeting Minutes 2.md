# Client Meeting II

**Date:** January 26, 2023

**Attendees:** Orvin Tritama, Qingyan Hu, Ryan Lu, Fareeha Hayat

**Location:** Microsoft Teams

**Goal:** Second meeting with client in second semester, update team development progress.


<br>


## Discussion Notes

We have updated the client with our newest progress with our developments. The client is now aware that:

	- We are looking into the development of the machine learning algorithm.

	- We have found a solution to vectorize the image using VGG16 2nd last layer.

	- We have successfully stored the vectorized image into the Milvus database.

	- We are refining the frontend using the feedback we received from the last peer evaluation session.

	- we are working on connecting the database to the website.
	
	

## Client Priority

	The client has establish the notion that developing the machine learning algorithm is the main priority of this semester.

	The client has ommited the requirement of having a working vector database to store vectors and image information.


  **The Client has given the green light for us to use the DeepImageSearch algorithm.**



## Things that needs to be discussed in the following meeting

	We have introduced the DeepImageSearch engine to the client and we will have to report back to him on the license and the viability of using the algorithm in our application.

The following meeting will take place on Microsoft Teams next Thursday 2pm.


## Extra

### Update on the other teams

##### Team B
the team has finished their back-end implementation. they were able to split the video into frames then feed that images into the algorithm. They claim to be on track to finish their project in the following weeks. They are still looking into the algorithm part, still no answer from them.

##### Team C
the team is working on exploring the algorithm. They have also been given the green light to work on the deep image search implementation. Things are looking good for that team as well. All the best to them.



####### **These are all the updates. Thank you for tuning into this week's minutes.**

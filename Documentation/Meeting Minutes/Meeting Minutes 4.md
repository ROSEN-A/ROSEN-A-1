**Location:** Microsoft Teams

**Goal:** Fourth meeting with client in the second semester, we will update team development progress and discuss the concerns over DeepImageSearch.

## Discussion Notes

In this meeting we have re-discussed with the client about the project scope and the things that he would like for us to develop in the remaining weeks.

In this meeting the client has shown his interest in active learning algorithm using support vector machine (SVM). He has shown his concern regarding the DeepImageSearch, suggesting that it is not viable.

However, due to time constraints we do not think that it will be possible for us to start the project over to implement the active learning algorithm using SVM.

**The client suggested that we meeting in the following weeks in person to hold a pizza party along with a hackathon that lasts around 8 hours. Preferrably around 3am.**
	
	

## Client Priority

The client priority remains in the active learning algorithm. However, this time he is more interested in the active learning algorithm using SVM.



## Things that needs to be discussed in the following meeting

wether the team agrees to a ROSEN hackathon and whether we should do it on a weekend 3am in the morning.
we will be discussing this with Gema too.

The following meeting will take place on Microsoft Teams next Thursday 2pm.

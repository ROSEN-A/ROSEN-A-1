**Date:** January 1, 2023

**Attendees:** Orvin Tritama, Qingyan Hu, Ryan Lu, Fareeha Hayat (Sick Leave)

**Location:** Microsoft Teams

**Goal:** First meeting with client in second semester, update team development progress.

## Discussion Notes

We have updated the client with our newest progress with our developments. The client is now aware that:

	- We are looking into the development of the machine learning algorithm.

	- We have found a solution to vectorize the image using VGG16 2nd last layer.

	- We have successfully stored the vectorized image into the Milvus database.

	- We are refining the frontend using the feedback we received from the last peer evaluation session.

	- we are working on connecting the database to the website.




## Client Priority

	The client has establish the notion that developing the machine learning algorithm is the main priority of this semester.

	The client has ommited the requirement of having a working vector database to store vectors and image information.




## Things that needs to be clarified in the following meeting

	- Orvin has discovered a deep image search algorithm that is related to our use case. We will have to seek approval with the client to implement the algorithm into our application.

	- the purpose of the website: is training the priority or is the final classified result the priority?

*Future meetings will be held at Thusday 2pm, via Microsoft Teams.

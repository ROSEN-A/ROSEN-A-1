# Client Meeting II

**Date:** October 6, 2022

**Attendees:** Orvin Tritama, Qingyan Hu, Fareeha Hayat, Ryan Lu

**Location:** Online - Microsoft Teams

**Goal:** Clarify functional requirements, discuss client expectations on end product.

## Discussion Notes

- The Blender prototype will be given to us for system modelling.

- The main task of the web application is to perform the active learning algorithm sequence.

- The webpage can upload the files from local system

- To start, the user should upload one image and it should be processed (vectors should be created) 

- the input can be a photo or a video

- we will likely use the photos and videos from Blender

- The video will be uploaded from local file system

- there is no solution to databse as of yet, we will use our own computer for data storage.

- no cloud implementation planned for the project

- The website will not be hosted on the internet, it will be a local system running from git repository

- use VGG16 to encode our photos

- One datapoint for each photo

- Use Blender file, render one Blender video, put fish (or something else) in it to test the system 

Make a script to automate steps (give me more fish, change the surface materialâ€¦) for generating videos 


## Potential Questions for next meeting

**Clarification Questions: **

we will have to implement our own active learning algorithm

Are we running the active learning algorithm against the prototype in blender to train it?

When this Active learning algorithm is optimized enough, are we expected to use this ALA to run it against the datasource that you have in ROSEN?

**Other Questions:**
Our timeline is divided into two terms with four milestones. This we will divide our task into two four month chunks.

Is there any expectations on what we will finish by the first 4 months and on the 2nd 4 months

With all the requirements we have to fulfill in the course itself, we need to have something working after the first 4months,  so it would make more sense to complete the website first in the first 4months, and start on integrating the image processing after, is that something you would be okay with?

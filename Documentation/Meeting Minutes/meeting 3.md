## Discussion Notes
To the client, the presentation was not very impressive. There was a clear misunderstanding between our team and the client.

Based on the client's feedback, what he wanted for the project was far from what we understood. The requirements were different, and the development process was also questioned.

The client wants us to prioritize the development of the active learning algorithm and the web interface is of less importance compared to the ML algorithm




## How the Web Application will work
Based on this week's meeting, we have a new understanding of how the web user interface should look like based on the requested input from the user.

Firstly, the user will upload a video of the water pipeline.

Then, the system will chop up the video into thousands of frames and that will be save to the local file system.

The user will then input a sample image of what they are looking for. For example, the user may be looking for fishes inside the water pipeline, then the sample image will include the fish object.

Our web application should be able to detect the objects in the sample image.

## Actionable steps to development

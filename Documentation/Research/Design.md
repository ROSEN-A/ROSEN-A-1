# Design Activity

## This document will be our starting tool to approach our design for the upcoming project
Note: This is considered a research for at the moment, for
1) The team's understanding and how to approach design strategies, and
2) Our team is yet to receive specific instructions or specifications from our client.
Once we are clear with what our requirements are and specifications, we will come up with a better and concrete design details.

## Design Architecture
**Definition:** 
- High-level design software to which developers can start adding details on the project.
- Definite/specific features can be added to the design as details of the project starts coming
- This helps to collaborate and start sketching out the big picture of the development, including creating a prototype

## How to design software architecture?
- Clear understanding of requirements
    - High level view or sketch, such as mind-mapping the requirements
    - Divide into functional and non-functional requirements needed
- Breaking down requirements into one-unit component
    - i.e: dividing architectural design into slices
- Create the prototype
    - Make sure it follows all guidelines
    - Revisions or peer review from team members
- Consider performance, scalability, portability, extensibility and compliance in design

## Example of design architecture

## Best Practices in software architecture design
- **Always** visualize the design (diagram, blueprint, etc)
- Design is an iteration. Revisions are necessary
- Be cautious of requirements, you don't want requirements to adversely affect the design, consequently the project
- Keep components and design updates in your mind as revisions are made

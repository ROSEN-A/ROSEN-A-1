# OpenCV
One of the tools that we will be using in this project is OpenCV as discussed with our client is OpenCV. 
What is OpenCV?
OpenCV (Open-source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. In simple words, OpenCV is a library used for image processing. 
OpenCV is useful to process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or anything that is categorized within pictures.

## What does OpenCV offer?
The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and sate-of-art computer vision and machine learning algorithm. For example:
- Face detection/ Face recognition
	- A technology that can match human face from a digital image or a video game against database of faces.
- Egomotion estimation
	- 3D motion of camera within an environment. 
	- Estimating camera’s motion to a rigid scene
- Gesture Recognition
	- Interpret human movement (gestures) via mathematical algorithms
- Human Computer Interaction
	- Learning in how human interact with computer systems.
- Object detection
	- Related to computer vision and image processing, this focuses on identifying instances of objects of a certain class such as human, buildings, cars within images and videos

## Example use cases of OpenCV
1. Automated inspection and surveillance
2. Tracking the number of people in a place (for instance, the foot traffic in a mall)
3. Vehicle count on highways along with their speeds
4. Street view image stitching
5. Defect detection in manufacturing processes
6. Interactive art installations
7. Video/image search and retrieval
8. Object recognition
9. TV Channels advertisement recognition
10. Robot and driver-less car navigation and control
11. Analyzing medical images
12. Figuring out 3D structure from motion captured in videos/ films  

## Advantage of OpenCV
- With the popularity of the library, tutorials are available for free (or paid) that makes it easier to use
- OpenCV is compatible with many high-level languages like Java/Python
- Open source means free to use
- Operate under BSD license, which imposes minimal restriction for the library use
- It uses of hardware acceleration and multi-core systems to deploy for efficient solution

## Why do we need this tool for the project?
- Client deals with water inspections using the tool that takes snapshots in 360 degrees flowing in a pipeline from one end to the other
- OpenCV would be very helpful in this case to be used to determine any impurities in the water or the pipeline.
- Our client’s backend will be built mainly in python, hence OpenCV will be a library to be used in this project

## How to use OpenCV (in Python)?
OpenCV is a library of python bindings designed for computer vision, which make it very simple to use in Python.
- To use: Simply `import cv2 (as cv)` in python
- There are several functions from this library itself that will very useful for image processing such as:
- Image processing in OpenCV like changing colorspace, image thresholding, smoothing images, etc..

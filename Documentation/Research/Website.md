A web application will be developed for project ROSEN.
This application will include an interface the client will interact with.
Data scientists will be allowed to classify and manage video footage of a water pipeline through this interface.
Specifically, users should be able to upload a video of the water pipeline and view the feedback the algorithm (backend) provides whether it detects if there are specific objects (such as fish) in the video frames or not.

The interface should be as simple as possible for the user to navigate.
The user should be able to view and select the video footage they want to encode from their computer's file explorer/manager through the application.
The web application must allow for large batches of data to be loaded in at once.
The web application will process the video frames as images using OpenCV in the backend.
After the video frames are processed as images, these images will run through the pre-trained algorithm.
The web application should provide feedback to the user after the algorithm runs, and show if any objects have been filtered out.

- The user should not be labelling any of the video frame images; labelling only occurs during the training phase by the developers.



## How to Use

To open the web application, open index.html.
It is recommended to use Google Chrome.

*Future instructions will be added here.*



---



- A template for the web interface has been created using Javascript and HTML.
- The interface for users to view image data will be implemented in future updates.
- The image classification function will be implemented in future updates.
- Further development of the web application will continue in future updates.
- Various frameworks may be implemented in future updates.

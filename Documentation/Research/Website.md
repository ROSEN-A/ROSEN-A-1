A web application will be developed for project ROSEN.
This application will include an interface the client will interact with.
It will allow data scientists to classify and manage large amounts of image data through this interface.
Specifically, users should be able to view the images of water pipeline debris they have loaded in, and view the feedback the pre-trained algorithm provides whether it detects if there are specific objects (such as fish) in these images or not.

The user should be able to view and select image files they want to encode from their computer's file explorer/manager through the application.
It must allow for large batches of data to be loaded in at once.
The interface should be as simple as possible for the user to navigate.
After encoding, the interface should provide feedback to the user if any objects have been filtered out.
The application should process the images and apply the encoding algorithm without any user input.

## How to Use

To open the web application, open index.html.
It is recommended to use Google Chrome.

*Future instructions will be added here.*

---

- A template for the web interface has been created using Javascript and HTML.
- The interface for users to view image data will be implemented in future updates.
- The image classification function will be implemented in future updates.
- Further development of the web application will continue in future updates.
- Various frameworks may be implemented in future updates.

# Blender

Blender is an open-source software for 3D computer graphics.
It can be used for purposes such as 3D modeling, rendering, animation, and simulation.
It also supports compositing and video editing.
Blender also supports scripting in languages such as Python.
This can be used to customize the application and to create specialized tools.
Sometimes these custom tools are added to future releases of Blender.
Blender can run on Windows, Macintosh, and Linus systems.
The interface uses OpenGL.
Blender is under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

## How to Use

- Install Blender using this [link](https://www.blender.org/download/).
- Upon opening Blender, there are menus and toolbars already open.
There are toolbars on the left and right.
File operations are at the top.
A timeline is at the bottom.
A 3D view in the center, which defaults to a cube mesh.
The mouse wheel button is clicked and dragged to rotate around the 3D view.
Shift + the mouse wheel button is clicked and dragged to move up, down, to, and away.
Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Right click an object to select, and click off the object to deselect.
Hold shift and right click to select multiple objects.
Press the A key to select or deselect everything.
Objects are highlighted when selected.
- Two modes in Blender are Object mode and Edit mode.
Object mode lets you select and move objects in the view.
Edit mode lets you select lines, planes, points, etc. of an object in the view.
- In the 3D view, there is a 3D cursor.
It defaults to the center of the view (the origin), but it can be moved by left clicking.
If you add a new object, it will display where the 3D cursor is.
- To add a mesh, locate the file operations at the top, and click the Add menu, where there will be a Mesh option.
You can press Tab to switch between the two modes.
- Some of the specific operations in Blender are select, translate, rotate, and scale.
When an object is selected, red, blue, and green arrows appear inside of it.
These arrows are the axes of the object, and allow the user to move the object precisely.
To translate an object, either right click and drag it, select the object and press G, or left click the axis and drag.
To rotate an object, select the object and press R.
For rotating around a specific axis, press R and then X, Y, or Z, depending on which axis you want to rotate around.
To scale an object, press S.
To stretch an object, press S, and then press X, Y, or Z depending on which axis you want to stretch along.
- In Edit mode, you can select vertices, lines, or planes at the bottom above the timeline (there are three icons displaying each type of selection on a cube).
You can select two or more vertices to merge by selecting the vertices, and press W.
You can select a vertex, line, or plane, and extend it by selecting and pressing E.
To cut an object into two, press CTRL+R and select the area to cut.
This is useful when wanting to cut certain parts of an object.
- In Object mode, you can modify your object the subdivision surface modifier.
This will smooth the object down, with properties in the right tool bar.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

- The advantage of using Blender is that it is free and flexible, there are many things you can do with Blender alone. It also has many resources available online.
- The disadvantage of using Blender is that it is not industry standard, and it has a steep learning curve. It also does not particularly specialize at one function.

## Why do we need this tool for the project?

For the ROSEN project, Blender will be used to prototype debris inside of water pipelines to train an active learning algorithm.
It will be used to create mock images of different pipeline conditions with varying types of debris.
This will be achieved using Blenderâ€™s modeling, simulation, and rendering capabilities.

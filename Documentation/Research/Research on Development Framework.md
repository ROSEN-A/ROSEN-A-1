# Web Development Framework
## Angular
### What is Angular?
AngularJS is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. It is an leading framework for building JavaScript-heavy single page-based web applications. Single page-based applications (SPA) load the entire content of a site within a single page, which is usually an index.html file. This means that once the main page is loaded, clicking on links will not reload the entire page, instead, it will simply update sections within the page itself. 
### Features of Angular
- Document Object Model (DOM)
  - DOM treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure where each node represents a part of the document. 
  - Instead of updating the nodes that were already updated, Angular will update the entire tree structure of HTML tags.
- TypeScript
  - All of TypeScript code compiles with JavaScript, which helps users write JavaScript code that is easier to understand, and can run smoothly on any platform. 
- Data Binding
  - Data Binding is a process enabling users to manipulate web page elements through a web browser. 
  - It uses dynamic HTML and does not require complicated scripting or programming.
- Testing
  - Angular uses the Jasmine testing framework, which provides multiple functionalities to write different kinds of test cases.
### Advantages of Angular
- The popularity of SPA-based web applications allow us to deliver rich, dynamic and fast-loading content that mimics that of desktop applications. 
- Custom Components
  - Angular enables users to create their own components with packed functionalities.
- Dependency Injection
  - Angular enables users to write modular services and inject them as needed.
- Testing
  - Angular has high testability, every part of the application is able to be tested. 
- Browser Compatibility
  - Angular is cross-platform and compatible with multiple browsers (E.g. Chrome, Firefox) and OSes (E.g. Windows, macOS and Linux).
### Limitations of Angular
- Steep Learning Curve
  - For beginners, Angular 4 may be challenging to learn because it is a complete framework and the basic components include many topics.
- Limited SEO Options
  - Angular offers limited SEO options and poor accessibility to search engine crawlers.
- Migration
  - The reason that why some companies don't use Angular often is the difficulty in proting js/jquery-based code to angular style architecture.
### D3.js
#### What is D3?
D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. It allows you to bind arbitrary data to a DOM, and then apply data-driven transformation to the document.
#### Example Uses
- Generate an HTML table from an array of numbers
- Use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction
#### Advantages
- D3 enables efficient manipulation of documents based on data
- D3 is extremely fase with minimal overhead
- D3 supports large sets and dynamic behaviours for interaction and animation
- D3â€™s functional style allows code reuse through a diverse collection of official and community-developed modules
#### Prerequisites
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Method chaining
- SVG
- Block programming
### Why use Angular for this project?
- JavaScript was recomended as the main development language, Angular is heavy JavaScript based. Therefore, Angular could be a good option of frameworks for this project.
- This project is a long-term project and a lot of modifications are potentially needed. Since Angular enables users to manipulate web page elements through a web browse without complex scripting or programming, this framework could be a good option. 
- D3 library was recomended by the client, which was also strong for manipulating data. In this project, there will be a lof data needing needing to be processed. Moreover, D3 natively supports JSON data, so it makes it really easy to integrate with Angular application. 
### Prerequisites
 - HTML
 - JavaScript
 - TypeScript
## Django
### What is Django?
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.
### Features of Django
- Object-Oriented
  - Django is a web framework written in Python that uses the OOP concept.
- Crafted as a batteries-included web framework
  - Django provides predefined codes for necessary resources such as
    - Security
    - Data manipulation
    - Session management
    - HTML templating
    - URL routing etc.
- Admin Interface
  - Admin interface provides developeers a login protected admin area for making all necessary changes
- Free Flow Coding
  - Django is a complete package in itself. It does not ask  the user fo any mandatory imports. 
  - It never adds any badly written codes or unwanted functions to the task. 
### Advantages of Django
- Rapid Development
  - Django was designed with the intention to make it easier to build
- Secure
  - Djangio helps developer to avoid many common security mistakes, for instance:
    - SQL injection
    - Cross-site scripting
    - Cross-site request forgery etc.
- Scalable
  - Django is Scalable in nature and has ability to switch from small to large scae application project
- Fully loaded
  - Django includes various helping task modules and libraries to handle common Web development takss. Including:
    - User authentication
    - Content administration
    - Site maps
    - Rss feeds etc.
- Versatile
  - Django allows it to build applications for different-different domains. Nowadays, companies using Django to build applications like:
    - Content management systems
    - Social networks sites
    - Scientific computing platforms etc.
### Limitations of Django
- Monolithicity
  - Django framework has a certain way to define and perform tasks. So it is mandatory for users that they can't user teir own file structure. If the user doesn't use the "Django way" of doing things, the user may not be able to deploy anything using Django.
- Cannot handle multiple requests at the same time
  - Many framworks including Java comnine these processes to cut down development time. Though as a modern software, Django cannot handle multiple request at the same time. 
- ORM system lacks features
  - Django's ORM system allows programmers to work with various databases at the same time and also undertake common database operations. However, it lacks some essential features  which are provided by other ORM systems. 
### Dash
#### What is Dash?
Django-dash (later on named Dash) is a customisable, modular dashboard application framework for Django. Dash allows users to create their own custom dashboards. Supports theeming (in Dash themes are called layouts) and multiple workspaces.
#### Example uses 
- Visualization of data
- Public dashboards
#### Advantages
- Customisale layouts
- Multiple workspaces
- Tunable access permissions to plugins
- Cloneable workplaces
#### Prerequisites
- Python
- OOP
### Why use Django for this project?
- Django is implemented in Python, this project's backnd might be mainly built in Python. Therefore, using Django as the web development language makes it consistent with the backend.
- Dash is the library recomended by the client, which is beneficial for data visualization. Moreover, it is also a framework for Django. Hence, Django is a good option for this project. 
- A lot of data will be processed in this project, Django contains many libraries for data analysis and for data visualization. 
### Prerequisites
- Python
- HTML
- JavaScript

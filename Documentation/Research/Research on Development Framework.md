# Development Framework
## Angular
### What is Angular?
AngularJS is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. It is an leading framework for building JavaScript-heavy single page-based web applications. Single page-based applications (SPA) load the entire content of a site within a single page, which is usually an index.html file. This means that once the main page is loaded, clicking on links will not reload the entire page, instead, it will simply update sections within the page itself. 
### Features of Angular
- Document Object Model (DOM)
  - DOM treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure where each node represents a part of the document. Instead of updating the nodes that were already updated, Angular will update the entire tree structure of HTML tags.
- TypeScript
  - All of TypeScript code compiles with JavaScript, which helps users write JavaScript code that is easier to understand, and can run smoothly on any platform. 
- Data Binding
  - Data Binding is a process enabling users to manipulate web page elements through a web browser. It uses dynamic HTML and does not require complicated scripting or programming.
- Testing
  - Angular uses the Jasmine testing framework, which provides multiple functionalities to write different kinds of test cases.
### Advantages of Angular
- The popularity of SPA-based web applications allow us to deliver rich, dynamic and fast-loading content that mimics that of desktop applications. 
- Custom Components
  - Angular enables users to create their own components with packed functionalities.
- Dependency Injection
  - Angular enables users to write modular services and inject them as needed.
- Testing
  - Angular has high testability, every part of the application is able to be tested. 
- Browser Compatibility
  - Angular is cross-platform and compatible with multiple browsers (E.g. Chrome, Firefox) and OSes (E.g. Windows, macOS and Linux).
### Limitations of Angular
- Steep Learning Curve
  - For beginners, Angular 4 may be challenging to learn because it is a complete framework and the basic components include many topics.
- Limited SEO Options
  - Angular offers limited SEO options and poor accessibility to search engine crawlers.
- Migration
  - The reason that why some companies don't use Angular often is the difficulty in proting js/jquery-based code to angular style architecture.
### D3.js
#### What is D3?
D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. It allows you to bind arbitrary data to a DOM, and then apply data-driven transformation to the document.
#### Example Uses
- Generate an HTML table from an array of numbers
- Use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction
#### Advantages
- D3 enables efficient manipulation of documents based on data
- D3 is extremely fase with minimal overhead
- D3 supports large sets and dynamic behaviours for interaction and animation
- D3â€™s functional style allows code reuse through a diverse collection of official and community-developed modules
### Why use Angular for this project?
- JavaScript was recomended as the main development language, Angular is heavy JavaScript based. Therefore, Angular could be a good option of frameworks for this project.
- This project is a long-term project and a lot of modifications are potentially needed. Since Angular enables users to manipulate web page elements through a web browse without complex scripting or programming, this framework could be a good option. 
- D3 library was recomended by the client, which was also strong for manipulating data. In this project, there will be a lof data needing needing to be processed. Moreover, D3 natively supports JSON data, so it makes it really easy to integrate with Angular application. 
### Prerequisites
 - HTML
 - JavaScript
 - TypeScript

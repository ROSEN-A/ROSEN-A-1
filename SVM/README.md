# Support Vector Machine

## What is SVM?
- Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. 

- The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N â€” the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.

### Advantages of SVM
- Effective in high dimensional spaces.

- Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.

## Hyperplane
- A hyperplane is a decision boundary that differentiates the two classes in SVM. A data point falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes. 

- The dimension of the hyperplane depends on the number of input features in the dataset. If we have 2 input features the hyper-plane will be a line. likewise, if the number of features is 3, it will become a two-dimensional plane.

## Support vector
- Support vectors are the data points that are nearest to the hyper-plane and affect the position and orientation of the hyper-plane. 

- We have to select a hyperplane, for which the margin, i.e the distance between support vectors and hyper-plane is maximum. Even a little interference in the position of these support vectors can change the hyper-plane.
